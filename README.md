# Phonepe_Pulse

**README**

**Project:** PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

**Overview:**

This project aims to extract and process data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository to gain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner using a live geo visualization dashboard built with Streamlit and Plotly in Python.

**Steps:**

1. Extract data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository through scripting and clone it.
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

**Implementation:**

The project can be implemented using the following steps:

1. **Data extraction:** Use a scripting language such as Python to clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository and extract the data.
2. **Data transformation:** Clean and pre-process the data as needed. This may involve converting the data to a suitable format, removing duplicate rows, and handling missing values.
3. **Database insertion:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database. This will allow for efficient storage and retrieval of the data.
4. **Dashboard creation:** Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. The dashboard should allow users to select different facts and figures to display, and it should update the visualization accordingly.
5. **Data retrieval:** Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. **Dropdown options:** Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

**Security, Efficiency, and User-Friendliness:**

The solution will be secure, efficient, and user-friendly by following these guidelines:

* **Security:** Use a strong password for the MySQL database and encrypt the data in transit.
* **Efficiency:** Use caching and other performance optimization techniques to improve the performance of the dashboard.
* **User-friendliness:** Design the dashboard with a user-friendly interface and provide clear instructions on how to use it.

**Accessibility:**

The dashboard will be easily accessible by deploying it to a cloud platform such as Heroku or AWS. This will allow users to access the dashboard from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Insights and Information:**

The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information about the data in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. For example, users can use the dashboard to:

* See which states and districts have the highest number of PhonePe users.
* Identify the most popular mobile brands used by PhonePe users.
* Understand the trends in PhonePe transactions over time.
* See which products and services are most popular among PhonePe users.

**Conclusion:**

This project will provide a valuable tool for visualizing and exploring the data in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository. The dashboard will be easy to use and will provide valuable insights and information to users.
